# T4_motion_detection_model

In this repository I implement a motion detection model for the direction selective cell T4 in the _Drosophila_ visual system. 
This model is published by Zavatone-Veth et al., 2020 and here I implement it in python as part of my master's module at JGU, Mainz.

Figure 1 of the main reference is completed and can be replicated via the script Figure_1.
The functions used in every script are in the script fig1_functions_latest.
